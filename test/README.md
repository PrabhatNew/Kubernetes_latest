    Copy and paste the script into a new file, e.g. create-deployment.sh.
    Make the file executable: chmod +x create-deployment.sh.
    Run the script: ./create-deployment.sh.
    Follow the prompts and enter the desired values for each field. If you don't want to enter a value for a particular field, just press Enter to accept the default value (if any).
    The script will generate a new deployment YAML file with the specified values, and save it as <deployment-name>.yaml in the current directory.
